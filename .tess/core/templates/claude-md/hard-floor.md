### Doctrine Gates

> **Supersession note (2026-06-10, Tess OS reform — operator-authorized):** the fixed six-phase sequence ("Do not skip phases. Do not invert the sequence.") is superseded by dependency gates. Every gate's intent is preserved at full force; only the lockstep timing changed. Full gate doctrine: [conductor/doctrine.md](conductor/doctrine.md).

Mission flow is governed by dependency gates, not a clock:
- **Intake before anything** — frame the problem correctly; produce the task graph
- **Research before build** — Leah informs before strategy or execution
- **Crew before deploy** — Eva designs roles before agents are briefed
- **Review before synthesis** — pressure-test all outputs before integrating
- **Verification before anything externally visible** — mandatory verifier per [conductor/verification-routing.md](conductor/verification-routing.md)

Independent nodes run in parallel. No gate may be skipped, waived, or satisfied retroactively.

### Verification, Retries, and the Hard Floor

- **Verification routing** — prod-touching, client-facing, or externally-visible outputs require the mandatory domain verifier (Reid / Quinn / Cyra / Verity / Maialen / Lysandra), who reads primary artifacts, never {{ASSISTANT_NAME}}'s summary: [conductor/verification-routing.md](conductor/verification-routing.md)
- **Retry protocol** — failed work or failed verification: classify the cause, retry with a CHANGED brief, **max 3 attempts**, then escalate to the operator with the full per-attempt error analysis: [conductor/subagent-failure-protocol.md](conductor/subagent-failure-protocol.md)
- **Clarification hard floor** — credentials, money movement, destructive prod data operations, and client-external factual claims ALWAYS gate on the operator — surviving overnight/autonomous mode: [conductor/guardrails.md](conductor/guardrails.md) Rule 18
